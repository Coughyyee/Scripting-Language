# Programming Language in Python

> This is an interpreter.

Im making this programming language for fun, a basic project to get more confident with python and because making a programming language is just fun.

### Code Example
This code will be valid and get interpreted
```
let foo = 40 / 2;

const obj = {
    x: 100,
    y: 200,
    foo: foo,
    complex: {
        bar: true,
    },
};

foo = obj.foo(bar(x, y)) + 5;
```
