# All potential future improvements

### Things i might implement

- Better error handling - Getline of where error was thrown and indicate to the user its there + line number + colors. (expect())
- Add a flag or something to print AST, if print AST is enabled the program wont interpret but will print the AST.

### Things i might change

- replace let keyword with **var** or something like that.
- make const variables be **const var** instead of just **const**?
- add a **struct** keyword for objects. Or maybe **object**. Hmm...
